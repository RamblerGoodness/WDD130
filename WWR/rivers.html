                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>
                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname 
                    long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it 
                    because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in 
                    love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and 
                    bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor 
                    is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy 
                    beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of 
                    the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the 
                    water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and 
                    warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with 
                    children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p>
                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green 
                    river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
                    desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from 
                    Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                    interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and 
                    great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the 
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget 
                    your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly 
                    unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with 
                    side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
                    rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people 
                    are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
