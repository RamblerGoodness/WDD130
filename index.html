    <h2> Hi I'm Thomas </h2>
    <p> 
        I'm a Software Engineering Major, I love to play guitar and hang out with my family.
        Me and my brothers love to play games online with each other. I am a full time student.
        I also work part time at the school on the grounds crew.
    </p>
    
    <h2> WWR </h2>
    <p>an assignment given out in my web design and development class. The goal was to make a specific 
        website. Everyone in the class made this site but they all are unique and different as we tried to
        design what we thought looked best. </p>

    <h2> A.I Daily Planner </h2>
    <p> 
        This is a project that I am working on with a few other students. We are trying to make a daily planner
        that will help you plan out your day. It will also be able to learn from you and help you plan your day
        better. This was a class assignment but we are not working on it anymore. The point of the class was to work
        on a class project and learn how to work with a team. It did work at some point but I am not sure if it is
        still working.
    </p>

    <h2>RPG Helper Bot</h2>
    <p> 
        This is a discord bot that I am making for my friends and I to use while playing D&D. It has a few different
        commands that can be used to help with the game. It can roll dice, keep track of initiative. It is still a work 
        in progress and I plan to add more features to it in the future. I am also working on a website for it that will
        have a few more features that I can't add to the bot. I am also looking for contributors to help me with the bot
        and to learn from. If you are interested in helping me with the bot you can find the link to the page below.
