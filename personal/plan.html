    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I have been playing around with AI art generation so i want to use this site to 
        show off what i've made so far. I also want to use this site to educate people about
        how AI art works. I will also use this site to show off my art made by AI and the
        technics I've learned.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Any one who might be interested in AI generated art. My target is people who are interested
         as a hobby. I wont be able to show them how to make AI art in a professional setting or use. 
         This is more to show off and get people interested in AI art.<BR>
        To best cater to the intended audience I should:<br>
        Give a brief explanation to AI art and what kind of AI model I use.<br>
        Give lots of examples of art that I generated and the prompts i used.<br>
        Show people how they can get started using AI to make there own art.<br></p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
